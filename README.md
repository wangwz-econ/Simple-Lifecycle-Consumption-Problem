# A Simple Lifecycle Consumption Problem
 This repository stores codes to replicate the tutorial from IFS (https://ifs.org.uk/publications/dynamic-economics-practice), which teaches how to numerically solve some basic lifecycle consumption-savings model (one continuous state variable and one continuous choice variable).

 My Replication notes are [here](https://lumbar-tick-4a3.notion.site/Dynamic-Economics-in-Practice-_-IFS-Notes-400712279106451aadcb268bbd596eea).
